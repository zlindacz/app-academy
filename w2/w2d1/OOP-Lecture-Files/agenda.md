# Quiz

---

#Q1 
- super calls the parent method of the same name, in this case #initialize
- super also passes all arguments to parent class

---

#Q2
- How can we refactor?
- Ensure always run, but retry reruns the codeblock

---

#Q3
- Information Hiding

---

#Q4
- Thinking about nouns, verbs and associations

---

# OOP
### Object Orientated Programming

---

A mechanism of exposing only interfaces and hiding implementation details from the user.

---

##Abstraction / Information Hiding

---

A mechanism of bundling data, and the functions that use the data.

---

##Encapsulation

---

The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types).

---

##Polymorphism

---

Enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.

---

##Inheritance

---

Breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to understand and work with. Also known as factoring.

---

##Decomposition

---

"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."

---

##Duck Typing

---

A class that is used as the basis for inheritance

---

##superclass / base class.

---

A class that inherits from a parent class.

---

##subclass / derived class

---

# Examples?

Note: 
- Animal Demo
- encapsulation/info hiding - making rows private in grid
- polymorphism - polymorphic board class
- inheritance - 
- decomposition - knights travails
- duck typing - human/computer game doesn't need to ask type
---

- Include is for adding methods to an instance of a class and extend is for adding class methods
- Extend can also add instance methods when called on an instance of an object

---

# Why OOP?

---

- reduces complexity
- makes code more robust
- limits inter-dependencies/decouples code
- makes our code more DRY
- supports refactoring

---

# Singleton Design Pattern

---

- a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object

---

# Null Object Pattern

---

- a design pattern that that uses an object with no referenced value or with defined neutral ("null") behavior

- `NullObject.instance`

---

# Chess UML
