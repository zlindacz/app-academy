https://www.stitchfix.com/ My app will be called "I made It". Users design clothes that will get made and shipped to their doors. App will start out featuring just dresses. User inputs their measurements, then drag and drop from rotating selection of styles, materials, and patterns. App will feature forum where people can share descriptions and pictures of their creations, comment/like/favorite others' designs. Bonus: live model that takes user's measurements and displays their creations virtually before they submit their design for production.

First choice is Registry Care, like where non-profits create registries for goods that they need from donors. Individuals select registries near them that are looking for what they want to donate. I also eventually want to make a sibling site called Registry Time, where non-profits list volunteer positions and individuals can find ways to donate their time.

Second choice is Bucket List, where users can create bucket lists, find others who share those dreams, arrange meet-ups, do those things together, and/or create forums to cheer each other on. The list will feature progress tracking, photo diaries, sharing in social media.
