# # This file is in the same format as your assessments.
# #
# # Make sure everything puts out as 'true' when you run the file.
# #
# # Give yourself an hour to complete this assessment.
# # When time is up, make sure you don't have any unexpected `end`s or infinite loops
# # that would keep your code from running.
# #
# # Rename the file to be your firstname and lastname.
# #
# # Do not use the internet.  If you forget a particular ruby method, write it yourself.
# #
# # Test your code with a few cases in addition to the ones we give
# # you.  When we grade you, we use different test cases to make sure your logic
# # is sound.
# #
# # Look at the test cases below the problem before you approach it.
# # Use the debugger when code doesn't run how you expect.
